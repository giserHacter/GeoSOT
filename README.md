In this python file, I also compare Google S2 and Uber H3 with custom GeoSOT encoding algorithm.
The function GeoSoT_encode_3D_32bits is for encoding 3d space data with 32bits and the format is "Gddddddd-ffffffff-mmmmmmmmm.uuuuuuu"
The function GeoSoT_encode_3D_96bits is for encoding 3d space data with 96bits

The related algorithm comes from the paper: "A Set of Integral Grid-Coding Algebraic Operations Based on GeoSOT-3D"
